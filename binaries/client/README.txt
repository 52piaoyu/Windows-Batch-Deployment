Before installing the client, you need to edit InstallClient.bat.txt and rename it to InstallClient.bat.
You can replace 127.0.0.1:9999 with your server IP or domain name.
If you don't set server before installation, the server will be localhost.
Then run ServerTestVB6GUI.EXE in SERVER directory, you can see that the local system is in the list.
